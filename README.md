# Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed

## Autosplitter
This autosplitter works on the PC Steam release of S&ASRT.
The script fully supports all speedrun categories.

## Behavior
* The timer will automatically start when you confirm your character selection at the first track for both All-Cups and World Tour categories
* In GP mode, splits are triggered as soon as you cross the finish line at the end of each track
* In World Tour, splits are triggered whenever you succesfully complete an event and gains stars for doing so. Failing an event will not trigger a split.
* Completing Race of Ages in Moonlight Park / Superstar Showdown will not trigger a split until you get to the credits screen, as those 2 events represent the last event of the Any%/100% category. When you have to re-do Race of Ages in Twilight Park in order to get the 4th star after unlocking S-class, LiveSplit will split correctly
* The in-game timer is grabbed from the game's memory directly.
